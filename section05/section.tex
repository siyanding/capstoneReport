\section{Testing}												
\label{sec:Testing}
In iterative and incremental development, testing is conducted during each increment after its implementation phase. So after the implementation of functional requirements, we began to test all the functions. Functional requirements like LoadImage and ExistSystem
are tested by manually observation. But extraction functionalities are not easily tested. To test extraction functionalities, we need thousands of actual forms from the Admission Office. We do not presently have access to actual forms due to privacy issues, therefore, we have collected a few dozen forms that were filled out with simulated information for testing extraction functionalities.We cannot determine the accuracy of the system since we do not yet have accessed to a image set of actual student information cards. Figure 19 and Figure 20 are two test examples:

This subsection gives a great deal of precise description supporting point 1.
