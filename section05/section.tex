\paragraph{} Because we chose an incremental model as a life cycle model so the most testing is done during each increment after its implementation phase. So when everything was implemented, the developer then tested the entire application.
\par The Android application is tested by used many times and it shows too be reasonable good. During the test, several functions has been improved. For example, the title on each page is not same, the system 'back' button should exit the application if it is pressed at the main page, 'find' button can only be activated once and 'cancel' button should be added when finding a gift.  
\par But image recognition related functionalities for Android application are not easily tested. To make sure the region we found was correct, we took different images of actual scenery and saw if the object found is what had been sent before. 
\par The web interface was mainly used to retrieve data and show it on the user interface. So we just test it by manual observation.
