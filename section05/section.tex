\par After GUI development came the object classes. The classes were tested as they were designed in the design phase. After they were all fully written, unit tests were created to check the error handling and functionality of each method in each class.

\par The web interface was mainly used to retrieve data and show it on the user interface. So we can just test it by manual observation. Figure shows the web user interface and database pair.

To make sure the region we found was correct, we took different images of actual scenery and saw if the object found is what had been sent before. We cannot determine the accuracy of the system since we do not yet have access to a image set of actual student information cards. Figure and Figure are two test examples:
