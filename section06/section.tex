\section{Conclusion And Future Enhancements}												
\label{sec:conclusion}
\paragraph{} With this program, we implemented a basic social software functions like \bsq{add friends}, \bsq{delete friends}, \bsq{sign in}, \bsq{sign up} and \bsq{edit profile} and we can also \bsq{send gifts} and \bsq{find gift} using third-party recognition library suggested by Dr. Hunt. Additionally, this program can navigate users to the gift location and detect user location in real time.
\par Before any new features are added to the main application, the testing of accuracy of gift recognition needs to be completed, which requires thousands of actual scenes from different places.
\par As we described in Section \ref{RequirementsOverview}, the navigation can only support 2D locations which means if the gift is sent in a building with many floors, this application won't be able to detect which floor the user at, so in the future, user locations will support 3D. Also, the gift in this application is only one image and we hope we will replace the gift to AR images.
\par The user interface should also be designed more attractively which is very important for an Android application. For this project, following parts will be considered as future enhancements: change user portrait shape to a circle, add paging to friends list and gifts list, show the user portrait at friend list and search list.
